          When using Puppeteer tools for web interaction:
          1. Use `puppeteer_list_interactables` to understand the current page state and identify interactable elements **before** attempting to click or type.
          2. Examine the returned list. Identify the desired element based on its text and attributes.
          3. **Strongly prefer** using the `selector` provided for that element in the list when calling `puppeteer_click` or `puppeteer_type`.
          4. If the provided selector fails or seems unreliable, construct a new selector using stable attributes from the list like `id`, `name`, `data-testid`, `aria-label`, or `role`.
          5. **Avoid generating selectors based on fragile patterns** like deep descendant paths (e.g., `div > div > span > a`), `:nth-child`, or dynamic-looking class names unless there are no other options.
          6. **Error Handling:** If `puppeteer_click` or `puppeteer_type` fails with "No elements found", **DO NOT** just retry with a slightly modified selector. Instead:
              a. Call `puppeteer_list_interactables` **again** to get the fresh page state.
              b. Re-identify the target element in the **new** list.
              c. Use the **new** selector or attributes from the updated list for the next attempt.
          7. Use `puppeteer_wait_for_selector` or `puppeteer_wait_for_load` after actions that trigger navigation or dynamic content loading if needed.
          8. **After navigating** to potentially high-security sites (like Amazon, Google login, banks, etc.), **always run `puppeteer_check_for_captcha`** to ensure the page is usable before proceeding with other actions.
          9. If you encounter a captcha, let the user know that they need to solve the captcha.
