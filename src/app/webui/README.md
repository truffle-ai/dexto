# Saiki

An interactive playground for testing MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and talking to AI agents.

## Features

- **Tool Testing Playground**: Connect and test MCP servers and their tools interactively
- **Simple Chat Interface**: Clean, focused conversation with AI agents
- **Server Management**: Easy connection and management of MCP servers
- **Tool Discovery**: Explore available tools and their capabilities
- **Configuration Export**: Export your tool setup for use with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start testing your tools.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI models to securely connect to external tools and data sources. Saiki provides a simple interface to:

- Connect to MCP servers
- Test tool functionality
- Chat with AI agents that have access to your tools
- Export configurations for other clients

## Quick Start

1. Connect a MCP server using the "Tools" panel
2. Test individual tools in the playground (`/playground`)
3. Chat with AI agents that can use your connected tools
4. Export your configuration when ready
