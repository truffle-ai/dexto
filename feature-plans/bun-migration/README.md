# Bun Migration (Package Manager + Runtime) + Native TypeScript

This folder tracks the plan and progress for migrating Dexto from pnpm/npm + Node to **Bun** (package manager **and** runtime), with a focus on **native TypeScript at runtime** for layered `.dexto` / `~/.dexto` customization.

## Files

- `PLAN.md` — detailed plan + rationale
- `TASKLIST.md` — live checklist of all migration work
- `WORKING_MEMORY.md` — scratchpad + current status (update after completing tasks)

## Editing scope (owner request)

Until explicitly changed, only modify the files listed above while working on the Bun migration.
