# How do AI Agents work?

AI agents operate by understanding your natural language instructions, reasoning about what needs to be done, and then taking actions to accomplish your goals. This process involves several key steps:

1. **Understanding:** The agent interprets your request using natural language processing.
2. **Planning:** It determines what actions or steps are needed to fulfill your request.
3. **Tool Selection:** The agent decides which tools or services are required to perform each step.
4. **Execution:** It invokes the selected tools, orchestrating them as needed to complete the task.

A key part of this process is the use of **tools** â€” external services, APIs, or modules that enable the agent to take real actions in the world. Tools are the bridge between the agent's reasoning and real-world effects.

Saiki CLI is an AI Agent that does all this for you - you just setup Saiki CLI the way you want to, and tell it what to do - Saiki CLI does the rest!

To learn more about tools and their role in Saiki, continue to the next section: [Tools](./tools.md).
