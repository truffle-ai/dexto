# Deployment guide

Saiki CLI and web playground allow you to build, run and save long-lived AI Agents.

This guide talks about how you can then deploy these AI agents, either locally or into the cloud.

Currently, Saiki integrates with Docker to deploy long-lived agents anywhere.

We are also working on CLI commands and a platform experience to simplify the deployment process!

## Docker guide 
Check [README.Docker.md](https://github.com/truffle-ai/saiki/blob/main/README.Docker.md)
