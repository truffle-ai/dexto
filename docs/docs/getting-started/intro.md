# Introduction

**An all-in-one toolkit to build agentic applications that turn natural language into real-world actions.**

Dexto is a universal agent intelligence layer for building collaborative, context-aware AI Agents & agentic apps. It orchestrates LLMs, tools, and data into persistent, stateful systems with memory, so you can rapidly create AI assistants, digital companions & copilots that think, act and feel alive.

Dexto combines a configuration-driven framework, robust runtime, and seamless developer experience so you can build, deploy, and iterate on your agents easily.

- **Framework** – Define agent behavior in YAML. Instantly swap models and tools without touching code.
- **Runtime** – Execution with orchestration, session management, conversation memory, and multimodal support.
- **Interfaces & Tooling** – Native support for CLI, Web, APIs, and a TypeScript SDK.
