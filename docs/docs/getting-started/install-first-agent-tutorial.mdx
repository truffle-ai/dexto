# Install Your First Agent

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Now that you have used Dexto to build your own agent, let's explore some of the in-built agents that come with Dexto.

<Tabs groupId="interface" defaultValue="webui" values={[
  { label: 'CLI', value: 'cli' },
  { label: 'WebUI', value: 'webui' },
]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

### 1. List available Agents

Dexto comes shipped with in-built agents for common use-cases.

Use the `list-agents` command to list the in-built agents.

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

You will see many different agents. Some of the available agents are:

- **Nano Banana Agent** â€“ Advanced image generation and editing using Google's Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)
- **Podcast Agent** â€“ Advanced podcast generation using Google Gemini TTS for multi-speaker audio content
- **Coding Agent** â€“ Expert software development assistant with comprehensive coding tools
- **Sora Video Agent** â€“ AI video generation using OpenAI's Sora technology
- **Database Agent** â€“ Demo agent for SQL queries and database operations
- **Image Editor Agent** â€“ Image editing and manipulation
- **Music Agent** â€“ Music creation and audio processing
- **Talk2PDF Agent** â€“ Document analysis and conversation
- **GitHub Agent** â€“ GitHub operations, PR analysis, and repository management
- **Product Researcher** â€“ Product naming and branding research
- **Triage Agent** â€“ Demo multi-agent customer support routing system

Each agent is pre-configured with the right tools, prompts, and LLM settings for its domain.

No setup required â€” just install and start using them.

**ðŸ“š See the full [Agent Registry](../guides/agent-registry.md) for detailed information about all available agents, their capabilities, and use cases.**

### 2. Install a new agent

```bash
dexto install music-agent
```

This will install the music-agent with your preferred LLM you chose during setup, and you can immediately start running it!

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

This command will verify that the agent was installed successfully.

### 3. Run the installed agent

```bash
dexto --agent music-agent
```

This opens the Web UI (the default) where you can interact with your newly installed music agent!

:::tip Terminal Mode
Prefer terminal-based interaction? Use `dexto --agent music-agent --mode cli` to run in CLI mode, where you can use slash commands like `/tools` to list available tools.
:::

Check out [Music Agent Demo and Tutorial](../tutorials/music-agent.md) for a full tutorial of how to use this agent.

### 4. Uninstall the agent
```bash
dexto uninstall music-agent
```

This command uninstalls the agent.

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

Verify the music-agent was successfully uninstalled.

### 5. Reinstall the agent with in-built LLM settings

```bash
dexto install music-agent --no-inject-preferences
```

The first time when you installed `music-agent`, Dexto automatically injected your preferred LLM you configured during setup to be the LLM for this agent.

To avoid this and use the default LLM shipped for the music-agent, use the `--no-inject-preferences` argument while installing the agent.

This is preferable for certain agents that work better with or require pre-set LLMs, such as the nano-banana agent, which requires gemini.

Now let's rerun the list-agents command to see the installed agents.

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

You will now see that the music-agent has a different LLM configuration (the default one, as opposed to your preferred one)

In case you install an agent incorrectly, or want to use the default LLM config, you can always uninstall and reinstall agents.

### 6. Use the `dexto which` command to find the path to your agent file

```bash
dexto which music-agent
```

This command will show you the path to the installed music-agent so you can edit it directly if you are comfortable!


### 7. Update the music-agent to be your default agent

Open the dexto preferences file:

```bash
vi ~/.dexto/preferences.yml
```

Update the `defaultAgent` from `default-agent` to `music-agent`

Before:
```yml
defaults:
  defaultAgent: default-agent
```

After:

```yml
defaults:
  defaultAgent: music-agent
```

Now re-start dexto without any arguments

```bash
dexto
```

This opens the Web UI with your new default agent. Ask it "Who are you?", and you will see that instead of the `default-agent`, dexto is now using the `music-agent`!

Similarly, if you want to change the default to any other agent, just update `defaultAgent` to any valid agent-name!

### 8. Run a new agent directly without install

```bash
dexto -a database-agent
```

If you don't run the install command first, Dexto will automatically install the agent with your preferred LLM and open the Web UI for you to start chatting!

You can now interact with the database agent in the Web UI, or close it and re-run the `list-agents` command to verify that the `database-agent` was installed.

:::note
Use `--no-auto-install` with `dexto` to disable the automatic install behavior.

### 1. View Available Agents

First, start the Dexto Web UI:

```bash
dexto --mode web
```

Click on the **Agent Selector** button (with the sparkle icon) at the top of the page to see all available agents.

![Agent sections](/img/screenshots/install-agent/webui-agent-sections.png)

The dropdown organizes agents into sections:
- **Custom Agents** â€“ Your personally created agents (with trash icon to delete)
- **Installed** â€“ Built-in agents you've already installed
- **Available** â€“ Built-in agents ready to install (with download icon)

**ðŸ“š See the full [Agent Registry](../guides/agent-registry.md) for detailed information about all available agents, their capabilities, and use cases.**

### 2. Install an Available Agent

Scroll to the **Available** section and find an agent you want to try, like **Music Agent**.

![Available agents](/img/screenshots/install-agent/webui-available-agents.png)

Click on the agent with the download icon. It will be installed automatically with your preferred LLM.

### 3. Switch to the Installed Agent

After installation, you need to open the Agent Selector again. The agent will now appear in the **Installed** section.

![Installed agents](/img/screenshots/install-agent/webui-installed-agents.png)

Click on **Music Agent** to switch to it.

### 4. Use Your Agent

You're now talking to the Music Agent! The Agent Selector button at the top shows which agent is currently active.

![Music agent active](/img/screenshots/install-agent/webui-agent-active.png)

You can start chatting with the music agent immediately. Try asking it about music creation or audio processing.

Check out [Music Agent Demo and Tutorial](../tutorials/music-agent.md) for a full tutorial of how to use this agent.

### 5. Delete Custom Agents

To delete a custom agent you created, open the Agent Selector dropdown and find it under **Custom Agents**. Click the **trash icon** next to it to delete.

:::note
Built-in agents (from the Installed or Available sections) cannot be deleted through the UI.
