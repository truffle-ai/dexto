# Build Your First Agent

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Let's create your first custom agent in under 5 minutes. We'll build a **Market Research Assistant** that can analyze competitors, research trends, and generate actionable insights.

## Step 1: Create Your Agent

Create a new directory and add a basic configuration:

```bash
mkdir market-research-assistant
cd market-research-assistant
```

Create a `market-research-assistant.yml` file with your preferred LLM provider:

<Tabs groupId="llm-provider" defaultValue="openai" values={[
  { label: 'OpenAI', value: 'openai' },
  { label: 'Anthropic', value: 'anthropic' },
  { label: 'Google', value: 'google' },
  { label: 'Groq', value: 'groq' },
  { label: 'xAI', value: 'xai' },
  { label: 'Cohere', value: 'cohere' },
]}> 
  <TabItem value="openai">

## Step 2: Add Research Tools

Add Exa's AI-powered web search capabilities to your agent:

```yaml
# market-research-assistant.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a Market Research Assistant specializing in competitive analysis and market intelligence.
  
  Your expertise includes:
  - Analyzing competitor strategies and positioning
  - Identifying market trends and opportunities
  - Researching customer pain points and needs
  - Generating actionable business insights
  
  Always provide data-driven insights with specific recommendations.

llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-5-mini
  apiKey: $OPENAI_API_KEY

mcpServers:
  # AI-powered web search for market research
  exa:
    type: http
    url: https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp
```

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

Run your agent and try a practical market research task:

```bash
dexto --agent market-research-assistant.yml "Research the AI coding assistant market. Analyze the top 3 competitors, their pricing strategies, and identify opportunities for a new entrant"
```

Your agent will:
1. 🔍 Use AI-powered search to find relevant companies and data
2. 📊 Analyze competitor strategies and market positioning
3. 📝 Generate a comprehensive market analysis report
4. 💡 Provide actionable recommendations

You can also use the Web UI for interactive research:

```bash
dexto --agent market-research-assistant.yml --mode web
```

## Try These Research Tasks

Once your agent is running, try these powerful research scenarios:

- *"Analyze how Notion, Obsidian, and Roam Research position themselves in the note-taking market."*
- *"Research the sustainable packaging industry and identify customer pain points."*
- *"Find emerging trends in remote work tools and 5 companies launched in 2024."*
- *"Research successful SaaS product launches and their marketing strategies."*

## That's It!

You've built a powerful Market Research Assistant in 3 simple steps:

1. ✅ Created a specialized `market-research-assistant.yml` configuration
2. ✅ Added web search, file system, and browsing tools  
3. ✅ Tested it with real market research tasks

This demonstrates Dexto's core philosophy: **configure declaratively, let the runtime handle orchestration, and focus on your agent's purpose rather than implementation details.**

Your agent can now:
- 🔍 Conduct comprehensive web searches
- 📊 Analyze competitor websites and strategies  
- 📝 Generate detailed research reports
- 💡 Provide actionable business insights
