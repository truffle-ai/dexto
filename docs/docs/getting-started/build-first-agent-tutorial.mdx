# Build Your First Agent

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Now that you have Dexto installed, let's build your first custom agent. This tutorial will guide you through creating an `agent.yml` file to define an agent with a unique personality and tools.

### 1. Create Your Agent Configuration
The heart of a Dexto agent is the `agent.yml` configuration file. This is where you declaratively define the agent's identity and capabilities.

Create a new directory for your project and add a basic configuration:

```bash
mkdir my-pirate-agent
cd my-pirate-agent
```

Now create a file `agent.yml`, and choose your LLM model and provider.

Choose the same one you picked when you setup dexto.

<Tabs groupId="llm-provider" defaultValue="openai" values={[
  { label: 'OpenAI', value: 'openai' },
  { label: 'Anthropic', value: 'anthropic' },
  { label: 'Google', value: 'google' },
  { label: 'Groq', value: 'groq' },
  { label: 'xAI', value: 'xai' },
  { label: 'Cohere', value: 'cohere' },
]}> 
  <TabItem value="openai">

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4.1-mini
  apiKey: $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="anthropic">

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

llm:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-4-sonnet-20250514
  apiKey: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="google">

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

llm:
  provider: google
  model: gemini-2.5-pro
  apiKey: $GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="groq">

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

llm:
  provider: groq
  model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
  apiKey: $GROQ_API_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="xai">

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

llm:
  provider: xai
  model: grok-4
  apiKey: $XAI_API_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cohere">

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

llm:
  provider: cohere
  model: command-a-03-2025
  apiKey: $COHERE_API_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This configuration sets your system prompt and selects a default model for the chosen provider. You can change models any time.

### 2. Give Your Agent a Personality
Let's customize your agent by giving it a distinct personality. Modify the `systemPrompt` to create a pirate-themed agent:

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  Ahoy! Ye be chattin' with a pirate AI. Speak like a pirate in all yer responses, savvy?
```

Now run your agent from inside the `my-pirate-agent` directory:

```bash
dexto --agent agent.yml "Who are you?"
```

Your agent should now respond like a pirate. You've just changed your agent's behavior through declarative configuration—no code required.

Note: You can also use `dexto -a <agent>` instead of `dexto --agent <agent>` as a short-hand.

### 3. Add Tool Integration
A core feature of Dexto is connecting agents to external tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Let's give your pirate agent web browsing capabilities.

Add the `playwright` tool to your configuration [llm section remains unchanged]:

```yaml
# agent.yml
systemPrompt: |
  Ahoy! Ye be chattin' with a pirate AI. Speak like a pirate in all yer responses, savvy?

mcpServers:
  playwright:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@playwright/mcp@latest"
```

The runtime will automatically handle tool installation and integration when you first run the agent.

### 4. Test Your Enhanced Agent In the Web UI
Start an interactive session with your enhanced agent, this time in the web UI:

```bash
dexto --agent agent.yml --mode web
```

This will open the Dexto Web UI, which is a web interface for you to talk to your agents.

Now ask it to use its new web browsing capability:
> `summarize the main points of the article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy`

Your agent will use the puppeteer tool to visit the webpage, read the content, and provide a summary (in pirate voice, of course).


## Congratulations!
You've just built and customized your first AI agent using declarative configuration. You've learned how to:

- ✅ Define an agent with `agent.yml` configuration
- ✅ Customize agent behavior through system prompts  
- ✅ Integrate external tools via MCP servers
- ✅ Run and interact with your agent using the runtime

This is the fundamental development workflow with Dexto: configure declaratively, let the runtime handle orchestration, and focus on your agent's purpose rather than implementation details.
