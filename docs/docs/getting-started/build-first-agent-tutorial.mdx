# Build Your First Agent

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Let's create your first custom agent in under 5 minutes. 

We'll build a **Market Research Assistant** that can analyze competitors, research trends, and generate actionable insights.

<Tabs groupId="interface" defaultValue="webui" values={[
  { label: 'CLI', value: 'cli' },
  { label: 'WebUI', value: 'webui' },
]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

## Step 1: Create Your Agent

Create a new directory and add a basic configuration:

```bash
mkdir market-research-assistant
cd market-research-assistant
```

Create a `market-research-assistant.yml` file with your preferred LLM provider:

<Tabs groupId="llm-provider" defaultValue="openai" values={[
  { label: 'OpenAI', value: 'openai' },
  { label: 'Anthropic', value: 'anthropic' },
  { label: 'Google', value: 'google' },
  { label: 'Groq', value: 'groq' },
  { label: 'xAI', value: 'xai' },
  { label: 'Cohere', value: 'cohere' },
]}>
  <TabItem value="openai">

## Step 2: Add Research Tools

Add Exa's AI-powered web search capabilities to your agent:

```yaml
# market-research-assistant.yml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a Market Research Assistant specializing in competitive analysis and market intelligence.

  Your expertise includes:
  - Analyzing competitor strategies and positioning
  - Identifying market trends and opportunities
  - Researching customer pain points and needs
  - Generating actionable business insights

  Always provide data-driven insights with specific recommendations.

llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-5-mini
  apiKey: $OPENAI_API_KEY

mcpServers:
  # AI-powered web search for market research
  exa:
    type: http
    url: https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp
```

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

Run your agent with a practical market research task:

```bash
dexto --agent market-research-assistant.yml
```

This opens the web UI.

Then ask the agent this:

```
Research the AI coding assistant market. Analyze the top 3 competitors, their pricing strategies, and identify opportunities for a new entrant
```

Your agent will:
1. üîç Use AI-powered search to find relevant companies and data
2. üìä Analyze competitor strategies and market positioning
3. üìù Generate a comprehensive market analysis report
4. üí° Provide actionable recommendations

:::tip CLI Mode
For terminal-based interaction, add `--mode cli`: `dexto --agent market-research-assistant.yml --mode cli`
:::

## Try These Research Tasks

Once your agent is running, try these powerful research scenarios:

- *"Analyze how Notion, Obsidian, and Roam Research position themselves in the note-taking market."*
- *"Research the sustainable packaging industry and identify customer pain points."*
- *"Find emerging trends in remote work tools and 5 companies launched in 2024."*
- *"Research successful SaaS product launches and their marketing strategies."*

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="webui">

## Step 1: Create a New Agent

First, start the Dexto Web UI:

```bash
dexto
```

Click on the **Agent Selector** button (with the sparkle icon) at the top of the page, then click **New Agent**.

![Create new agent](/img/screenshots/build-agent/webui-new-agent-button.png)

This opens the agent creation modal where you can configure your agent. Fill in the basic information:

1. **Agent ID**: `market-research-agent`
2. **Agent Name**: `Market Research Agent`
3. **Description**: `An agent to help with market research and analysis.`
4. **Tags**: `coding, custom, specialized`

## Step 2: Configure the LLM

Choose your LLM provider and model. Select the same one you picked when you set up Dexto.

![Configure LLM](/img/screenshots/build-agent/webui-llm-config.png)

The available providers include:
- OpenAI (e.g., gpt-5-mini)
- Anthropic (e.g., claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- Google (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro)
- Groq (e.g., llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- xAI (e.g., grok-4)
- Cohere (e.g., command-a-03-2025)

## Step 3: Set the System Prompt

Scroll to the **System Prompt** section and configure your agent's personality and expertise:

![Configure system prompt](/img/screenshots/build-agent/webui-system-prompt.png)

Enter this system prompt:

```
You are a Market Research Assistant specializing in competitive analysis and market intelligence.

Your expertise includes:
- Analyzing competitor strategies and positioning
- Identifying market trends and opportunities
- Researching customer pain points and needs
- Generating actionable business insights

Always provide data-driven insights with specific recommendations.
```

Click **Create Agent** to create your agent with all the configurations.

## Step 4: Switch to Your New Agent

After creating the agent, you need to switch to it. Click the **Agent Selector** button at the top and select your newly created **Market Research Agent** from the dropdown.

## Step 5: Connect Research Tools

Now that you've switched to your agent, let's add tools to give it research capabilities. Click the **Connect MCPs** button in the Tools & Servers panel on the right side to open the MCP Server Registry.

![Add MCP server](/img/screenshots/build-agent/webui-mcp-servers.png)

Search for **Exa** and click to add it. This gives your agent AI-powered web search capabilities for market research. Once added, click the connect button to activate the server.

## Step 6: Test Your Agent

Now you're ready to test your agent! You can see it's active in the Agent Selector button at the top, and the Exa tool is connected in the Tools & Servers panel.

![Market Research Agent active](/img/screenshots/build-agent/webui-agent-active.png)

Test your agent with a practical market research task:

```
Research the AI coding assistant market. Analyze the top 3 competitors, their pricing strategies, and identify opportunities for a new entrant
```

Your agent will:
1. üîç Use AI-powered search to find relevant companies and data
2. üìä Analyze competitor strategies and market positioning
3. üìù Generate a comprehensive market analysis report
4. üí° Provide actionable recommendations

## Try These Research Tasks

Once your agent is running, try these powerful research scenarios:

- *"Analyze how Notion, Obsidian, and Roam Research position themselves in the note-taking market."*
- *"Research the sustainable packaging industry and identify customer pain points."*
- *"Find emerging trends in remote work tools and 5 companies launched in 2024."*
- *"Research successful SaaS product launches and their marketing strategies."*

## Step 7: Edit Your Agent (Optional)

You can edit your agent's configuration at any time:

1. Click the **Customize** button (pencil icon) in the sidebar
2. This opens the Agent Editor where you can:
   - Modify the system prompt
   - Change LLM settings
   - Add or remove MCP servers
   - Configure storage options

![Agent editor](/img/screenshots/build-agent/webui-agent-editor.png)

Changes are saved automatically and take effect immediately.
