# What is an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is an autonomous software entity that can perceive its environment, reason about what it observes, and take actions to achieve specific goals—often using artificial intelligence techniques.

## Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy:** Operates independently, making decisions without constant human intervention.
- **Perception:** Gathers information from its environment (e.g., via APIs, sensors, or user input).
- **Reasoning:** Processes information, plans, and makes decisions based on goals and context.
- **Action:** Executes tasks, commands, or workflows to achieve its objectives.
- **Learning (optional):** Some agents can adapt and improve over time

## What is Saiki?

Saiki is a framework to help you build customizable, flexible AI Agents.

Saiki AI agents can:
- Understand natural language instructions from users
- Select and orchestrate the right tools, apps, or services to fulfill those instructions

**Example:**
> "Summarize my latest emails and send the highlights to Slack."

A Saiki AI agent will:
1. Parse your request
2. Connect to your email and Slack services
3. Summarize the emails
4. Send the summary to Slack—all automatically

## Why AI Agents Matter

AI agents make it possible to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual effort or custom scripting. They are the foundation for building intelligent, user-friendly experiences. We think that we are going to be seeing a lot more AI Agents in the coming years!
