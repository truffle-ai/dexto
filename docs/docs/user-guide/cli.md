# CLI Guide

This guide helps you get started with the Saiki CLI and includes a comprehensive list of commands you can run with Saiki CLI.

Saiki CLI is the easiest way to get started with AI agents.

Some of the cool things you can do with Saiki CLI:

- Talk to any LLM in your terminal
- Create long-lived AI agents with tools, knowledge and memories. Example: a productivity agent that integrates with your linear and github.
- Deploy these agents either locally or on the cloud
- Talk to these agents on any application - discord, telegram, slack, cursor, claude desktop, etc.
- Start building your own AI applications - get started with building your own Cursor! `saiki create-app`


More CLI commands coming soon! Request a CLI command here.


#### **See all available options and flags:**

```bash
saiki -h
```

#### **Launch the interactive CLI:**
```bash
saiki
```

#### **Start saiki CLI with a different LLM**
```bash
# openai
saiki -m gpt-4o

# anthropic
saiki -m claude-4-sonnet-20250514

# google
saiki -m gemini-2.0-flash
```


#### **Start saiki with a different config file**

This allows you to configure saiki CLI to use a different AI agent
```bash
saiki --config-file <path_to_agent_config_file>
```

Check [Configuration Guide](../configuring-saiki/configuration.md) to understand more about saiki config files

#### **Run a specific command with Saiki CLI:**

```bash
saiki find all .sh files in this directory
```

or do the same with gemini:

```bash
saiki -m gemini-2.0-flash find all files in this directory
```

Saiki CLI can accept __any__ command - if it doesn't see it as an in-built command, it will fire a single run CLI with that request

For instance, in the above command, the query "find all .sh files in this directory" will start Saiki Agent, send it this query, process the response, and then exit.


#### **Start a telegram bot**

```bash
saiki --mode telegram
```
To use a specific agent config file for the telegram bot:
```bash
saiki --mode telegram --config-file ./telegram-agent-config.yml
```

<!-- Todo: add telegram demo -->

#### **Start a discord bot**
```bash
saiki --mode discord
```
To use a specific agent config file for the discord bot:
```bash
saiki --mode discord --config-file ./discord-agent-config.yml
```

<!-- Todo: add discord demo -->

#### **Start saiki as an MCP server**
```bash
saiki --mode mcp
```

With this, you can now connect this agent to Cursor, claude desktop, or even other Saiki agents!


#### **Change log level for saiki CLI**

To change the logging level, set environment variable `SAIKI_LOG_LEVEL` to 'info', 'debug', or 'silly'. Default is 'info'.

ex: for debug logs:
```bash
SAIKI_LOG_LEVEL=debug
saiki what is the time
```


## Project setup commands

These commands will help you get started creating your own AI application using Saiki

Setup a fresh typescript project using saiki-core
```bash
saiki create-app
```

Add saiki into an existing typescript project
```bash
saiki init-app
```

Check [Building with Saiki Guide](../building-with-saiki/) for more information!
