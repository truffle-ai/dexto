# Web playground 

## Overview

Saiki web playground is the easiest way to build useful AI agents.

It gives you an interactive way to test out different LLMs, MCP servers, prompts, and more.

Once you're satisfied with a specific combination, save it as a **Re-usable** AI agent built with Saiki, and deploy the agent anywhere.

All this is possible because Saiki sees any valid config file as a re-usable AI agent. 


## Get started
**Start saiki web playground:**

```bash
saiki --mode web
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Or open saiki web playground in a different port:

```bash
saiki --mode web --web-port 3333
```
