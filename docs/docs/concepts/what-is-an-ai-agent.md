# What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a program that can understand a goal, make a plan, and use a set of tools to execute that plan. Think of it as an autonomous worker that can operate digital tools on your behalf.

At a high level, most AI agents share a common structure:

1.  **Goal:** They are given a high-level objective in natural language (e.g., "summarize this report," "book a flight," "organize my files").
2.  **Reasoning:** The agent, typically powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), breaks down the goal into a sequence of steps.
3.  **Tools:** The agent has access to a set of tools (like APIs, web browsers, or file system commands) that it can use to execute the steps.
4.  **Observation:** After each action, the agent observes the result (e.g., the output of a command, the content of a webpage) and uses that information to decide the next step.
5.  **Execution:** The agent continues this loop of reasoning, tool use, and observation until the goal is achieved.

## Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy:** Agents can operate independently to achieve a goal without step-by-step human guidance.
- **Goal-Oriented:** Their actions are driven by the objective they are trying to achieve.
- **Tool-Using:** They don't just process information; they take action by using external tools.
- **Adaptive:** They can react to the results of their actions and adjust their plan accordingly.

AI agents represent a shift from simple instruction-following programs to more dynamic, goal-oriented systems that can navigate complex digital environments. Check out this blog post where we explore this in depth.
