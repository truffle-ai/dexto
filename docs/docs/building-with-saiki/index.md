## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **An API key** from one of the [supported LLM providers](../../configuring-saiki/llm/)
- **Basic TypeScript/JavaScript** knowledge
- **A code editor** (VS Code recommended)

## The Saiki Philosophy

Saiki follows a **configuration-first approach**. Instead of writing complex code to integrate AI capabilities, you:

1. **Configure capabilities** through YAML files
2. **Define behavior** with system prompts
3. **Connect tools** via MCP servers
4. **Build applications** with simple API calls

This approach means you can focus on **what your AI should do**, not **how to make it work**.

## Quick Example

Here's a complete AI agent in just a few lines:

```typescript
import { loadConfigFile, createSaikiAgent } from '@truffle-ai/saiki';

// Load configuration
const config = await loadConfigFile('./agents/saiki.yml');

// Create agent
const agent = await createSaikiAgent(config);

// Use it!
const response = await agent.run("What files are in this directory?");
console.log(response);
```

That's it! You now have an AI agent with file system capabilities.
