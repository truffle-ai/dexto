# What's Next

You now understand how to build AI applications with Saiki! Here's how to keep growing and take your applications to the next level.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Experiment with Different Providers
Try different LLM providers to find what works best for your use case:

```yaml
# Fast and cost-effective
llm:
  provider: groq
  model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
  apiKey: $GROQ_API_KEY

# Large context for complex tasks
llm:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  apiKey: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Multimodal capabilities
llm:
  provider: google
  model: gemini-2.0-flash
  apiKey: $GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
```

**Learn more**: [LLM Providers Guide](../configuring-saiki/llm/providers)

### 2. Add More Tools
Expand your agents' capabilities with additional MCP servers:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  filesystem:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
  
  puppeteer:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@truffle-ai/puppeteer-server"]
  
  # Add database access, API calls, and more!
```

**Learn more**: [MCP Server Configuration](../configuring-saiki/mcpServers)

### 3. Deploy Your Application
Take your application to production:

- **Development**: Run locally with `npm start`
- **Production**: Use Docker containers with proper monitoring

**Learn more**: [Deployment Guide](../user-guide/deployment)

## Pro Tips for Saiki Success

### ‚úÖ Use Specific Prompts
```yaml
# ‚ùå Vague
systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant."

# ‚úÖ Specific
systemPrompt: |
  You are a code review assistant specializing in security.
  Always check for SQL injection, XSS, and authentication issues.
  Provide specific line numbers and fix suggestions.
```

### ‚úÖ Handle Errors Gracefully in Your Application
When interacting with Saiki agents:
```typescript
try {
  const response = await agent.run(message); // Assuming 'agent' is your Saiki agent instance
  return response;
} catch (error) {
  // Log the error for debugging
  console.error('Saiki Agent error:', error);
  
  // Return helpful message to user
  return "I'm having trouble processing that request with the AI agent. Could you try rephrasing it?";
}
```

### ‚úÖ Optimize for Your Use Case with Saiki Configurations

**For Speed**:
```yaml
llm:
  provider: groq
  model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
  providerOptions:
    temperature: 0.1  # More deterministic
```

**For Quality**:
```yaml
llm:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  providerOptions:
    temperature: 0.3  # Balanced creativity
```

**For Cost**:
```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4.1-mini  # Cheaper than full GPT-4
```

## Common Saiki Patterns to Explore

### 1. Agent Specialization
Create different Saiki agents for different tasks:
- **Code Reviewer** - Focus on security and best practices
- **Documentation Writer** - Generate clear, comprehensive docs
- **Data Analyst** - Analyze and visualize data
- **Customer Support** - Handle user questions

### 2. Workflow Automation with Saiki
Chain multiple Saiki agents or calls together:
1. **Analyzer Agent** - Understand the problem
2. **Planner Agent** - Create a solution plan based on Analyzer's output
3. **Executor Agent** - Implement the solution using tools
4. **Reviewer Agent** - Validate the results

## Scaling Your Saiki Applications

### Performance Considerations for Saiki
- **Use faster models** configured in Saiki for latency-sensitive tasks.
- **Cache LLM responses** where appropriate to reduce redundant API calls, especially for frequently requested information.
- **Optimize tool usage** within your agents to ensure they perform efficiently.

### Cost Optimization with Saiki
- **Choose appropriate LLM models** in your Saiki configuration for each task's complexity and budget.
- **Optimize prompts** for your Saiki agents to reduce token usage.
- **Cache results** from Saiki agents or LLM calls if the same information is requested repeatedly.

### Security Best Practices for Saiki
- **Never hardcode API keys** in your Saiki configurations. Use environment variables (e.g., `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- **Validate and sanitize user inputs** before passing them to Saiki agents to prevent prompt injection or misuse of tools.
- **Restrict tool permissions** for MCP servers to only what is necessary for the agent's function.
