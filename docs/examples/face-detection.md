This example demonstrates Dexto's computer vision capabilities using the image-editor-agent. The agent can:

- Detect faces in uploaded images
- Draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Process various image formats
- Perform advanced image analysis tasks

The image-editor-agent uses specialized MCP servers for image processing and computer vision tasks.
