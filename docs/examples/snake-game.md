This example showcases Dexto's web development capabilities. The default agent can:

- Generate complete web applications from natural language
- Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code
- Automatically open the created application in a browser
- Handle full-stack development tasks

The agent uses filesystem tools to create files and browser tools to open and test the application, demonstrating the power of combining multiple MCP servers for complex workflows.
