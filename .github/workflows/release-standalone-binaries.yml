# Backfill-only workflow for standalone CLI binary assets.
#
# Normal path:
# - `Changesets - Release` now builds and uploads standalone binaries automatically
#   after publishing the `dexto` package.
#
# Run this workflow manually only when recovery is needed, for example:
# - publish succeeded but release assets are missing
# - binary upload job failed and needs a retry for an existing release tag
#
# Manual trigger example:
#   gh workflow run release-standalone-binaries.yml \
#     --repo truffle-ai/dexto \
#     -f release_tag=dexto@1.6.3
#
# Notes:
# - `release_tag` must match an existing GitHub Release (format: dexto@<version>)
# - Upload uses `--clobber`, so existing assets with the same names are replaced
