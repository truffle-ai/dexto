# Changesets - Release
#
# NPM Authentication: Using granular access token (NPM_TOKEN secret)
#
# OIDC Trusted Publishing - Deferred (Jan 14, 2026)
# We attempted OIDC-based npm publishing but reverted due to:
#   1. Requires manual first publish for any new packages
#   2. Requires setting up trusted publishers per-package (no org-level support)
#   3. Early adoption phase - slow and painful setup process
#   4. No human-in-the-loop/2FA for CI releases (security tradeoff)
# See attempted implementation: https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto/commit/a2ff7237186ce21f0ff36edbf7b79794432cf572

# Revisit when npm OIDC matures and supports org-level configuration.
