    - Fix `@dexto/tools-todo` versioning - add to fixed version group in changeset config

    ### Configuration Changes

    - Add package versioning guidelines to AGENTS.md

## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 63fa083: Session and context management fixes:
    - Remove continuation session logic after compaction, now sticks to same session
    - `/clear` continues same session and resets context (frees up AI context window)
    - `/new` command creates new session with fresh context and clears screen
    - Add context tokens remaining to footer, align context calculations everywhere
    - Fix context calculation logic by including cache read tokens

    Other improvements:
    - Fix code block syntax highlighting in terminal (uses cli-highlight)
    - Make terminal the default mode during onboarding
    - Reduce OTEL dependency bloat by replacing auto-instrumentation with specific packages (47 MB saved: 65 MB → 18 MB)

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 0016cd3: Bug fixes and updates for compaction. Also added UI enhancements for compaction.
- 499b890: Fix model override persistence after compaction and improve context token tracking

    **Bug Fixes:**
    - Fix model override resetting to config model after compaction (now respects session overrides)

    **Context Tracking Improvements:**
    - New algorithm uses actual `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` from LLM responses as source of truth
    - Self-correcting estimates: inaccuracies auto-correct when next LLM response arrives
    - Handles pruning automatically (next response's input_tokens reflects pruned state)
    - `/context` and compaction decisions now share common calculation logic
    - Removed `outputBuffer` concept in favor of single configurable threshold
    - Default compaction threshold lowered to 90%

    **New `/context` Command:**
    - Interactive overlay with stacked token bar visualization
    - Breakdown by component: system prompt, tools, messages, free space, auto-compact buffer
    - Expandable per-tool token details
    - Shows pruned tool count and compaction history

    **Observability:**
    - Comparison logging between estimated vs actual tokens for calibration
    - `dexto_llm_tokens_consumed` metric now includes estimated input tokens and accuracy metrics

- aa2c9a0: - new --dev flag for using dev mode with the CLI (for maintainers) (sets DEXTO_DEV_MODE=true and ensures local files are used)
    - improved bash tool descriptions
    - fixed explore agent task description getting truncated
    - fixed some alignment issues
    - fix search/find tools not asking approval for working outside directory
    - add sound feature (sounds when approval reqd, when loop done)
        - configurable in `preferences.yml` (on by default) and in `~/.dexto/sounds`, instructions in comment in `~/.dexto/preferences.yml`
    - add new `env` system prompt contributor that includes info about os, working directory, git status. useful for coding agent to get enough context to improve cmd construction without unnecessary directory shifts
    - support for loading `.claude/commands` and `.cursor/commands` global and local commands in addition to `.dexto/commands`

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 4f00295: Added spawn-agent tools and explore agent.
- 69c944c: File integrity & performance improvements, approval system fixes, and developer experience enhancements

    ### File System Improvements
    - **File integrity protection**: Store file hashes to prevent edits from corrupting files when content changes between operations (resolves #516)
    - **Performance optimization**: Disable backups and remove redundant reads, switch to async non-blocking reads for faster file writes

    ### Approval System Fixes
    - **Coding agent auto-approve**: Fix auto-approve not working due to incorrect tool names in auto-approve policies
    - **Parallel tool calls**: Fix multiple parallel same-tool calls requiring redundant approvals - now checks all waiting approvals and resolves ones affected by newly approved commands
    - **Refactored CLI approval handler**: Decoupled approval handler pattern from server for better separation of concerns

    ### Shell & Scripting Fixes
    - **Bash mode aliases**: Fix bash mode not honoring zsh aliases
    - **Script improvements**: Miscellaneous script improvements for better developer experience

    - Support custom PostgreSQL schemas via `options.schema` config
    - Add schema name validation to prevent SQL injection
    - Improve connection pool error handling to prevent process crashes

    **Privacy mode:**
    - Add `--privacy-mode` CLI flag to hide file paths from output (useful for screen recording/sharing)
    - Can also be enabled via `DEXTO_PRIVACY_MODE=true` environment variable

    **Session improvements:**
    - Add message deduplication in history provider to handle data corruption gracefully
    - Add warning when conversation history hits 10k message limit
    - Improve session deletion to ensure messages are always cleaned up

    **Other fixes:**

## 1.2.5

### Patch Changes

- c1e814f: ## Logger v2 & Config Enrichment

    ### New Features
    - **Multi-transport logging system**: Configure console, file, and remote logging transports via `logger` field in agent.yml. Supports log levels (error, warn, info, debug, silly) and automatic log rotation for file transports.
    - **Per-agent isolation**: CLI automatically creates per-agent log files at `~/.dexto/logs/<agent-id>.log`, database at `~/.dexto/database/<agent-id>.db`, and blob storage at `~/.dexto/blobs/<agent-id>/`
    - **Agent ID derivation**: Agent ID is now automatically derived from `agentCard.name` (sanitized) or config filename, enabling proper multi-agent isolation without manual configuration

    ### Breaking Changes
    - **Storage blob default changed**: Default blob storage type changed from `local` to `in-memory`. Existing configs with explicit `blob: { type: 'local' }` are unaffected. CLI enrichment provides automatic paths for SQLite and local blob storage.

    ### Improvements
    - **Config enrichment layer**: New `enrichAgentConfig()` in agent-management package adds per-agent paths before initialization, eliminating path resolution in core services
    - **Logger error factory**: Added typed error factory pattern for logger errors following project conventions
    - **Removed wildcard exports**: Logger module now uses explicit named exports for better tree-shaking

    ### Documentation
    - Added complete logger configuration section to agent.yml documentation
    - Documented agentId field and derivation rules
    - Updated storage documentation with CLI auto-configuration notes
    - Added logger v2 architecture notes to core README

- f9bca72: Add changeset for dropping defaultSessions from core layers.
- c0a10cd: Add changeset for mcp http mode patches.
- 81598b5: Decoupled elicitation from tool confirmation. Added `DenialReason` enum and structured error messages to approval responses.
    - Tool approvals and elicitation now independently configurable via `elicitation.enabled` config
    - Approval errors include `reason` (user_denied, timeout, system_denied, etc.) and `message` fields
    - Enables `auto-approve` for tools while preserving interactive elicitation

    Config files without the new `elicitation` section will use defaults. No legacy code paths.

- 4c90ffe: Add changeset for updated telemetry spans.
- 1a20506: update source context usage to also go through preferences + registry flow. added dexto_dev_mode flag for maintainers
