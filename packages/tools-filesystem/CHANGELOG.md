# @dexto/tools-filesystem

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- facabe1: Rebuild DI + image-based config resolution

    This release rebuilds Dexto’s core/runtime to be DI-first, and moves YAML/config concerns into a dedicated adapter layer.

    **Highlights**
    - **DI-first `@dexto/core`**: `DextoAgent` is now constructed with concrete dependencies (logger, storage backends, tools, plugins, compaction strategy). Core no longer creates these from YAML.
    - **New `@dexto/agent-config` package**: owns the YAML/Zod schemas and provides the “YAML → validated config → resolved services → `DextoAgentOptions`” pipeline (including image loading + defaults).
    - **Images define the YAML surface**: agents can reference an `image:` (e.g. `@dexto/image-local`) that provides defaults + factories for tools/plugins/compaction/storage. The CLI can install/manage images in the user image store (`~/.dexto/images` by default).
    - **New `@dexto/storage` package**: extracted concrete storage implementations out of core. Core keeps storage interfaces + `StorageManager`; images/hosts provide implementations.
    - **Tools refactor**: tool packs are now configured via image tool factories; tool execution uses a required `ToolExecutionContext`. Built-in tools ship via **new** `@dexto/tools-builtins`.
    - **Agent events**: event bus is no longer exposed directly; use `agent.on()/off()` and `agent.registerSubscriber()` (server SSE/webhook subscribers updated).

    **Breaking/migration notes**
    - Programmatic usage must construct the agent via `new DextoAgent({ ...runtimeSettings, logger, storage, tools, plugins, compaction })` (the old config-first construction path is removed).
    - Config/YAML usage should go through `@dexto/agent-management` (load/enrich) + `@dexto/agent-config` (validate + resolve services + `toDextoAgentOptions()`).
    - Server “save/apply config” endpoints now rely on host-owned config paths (core no longer tracks file paths and no longer supports `agent.reload()`).

### Patch Changes

- d6b4368: Tool type-safety + validation improvements
    - Preserve Zod-derived input types through `defineTool()`/`Tool<TSchema>` so tool factories expose typed `execute()` inputs to callers.
    - Centralize local tool arg validation in ToolManager (and re-validate after hook mutation) so tools always receive schema-validated args and defaults/coercions are consistently applied.
    - Refactor filesystem tool directory-access approvals to share a single helper and keep approval/execution path resolution consistent.
    - Small UX/consistency fixes across plan/process/orchestration tools and the CLI config summary output.

- 99cf1c6: Refactors
    - Agent config terminology updates:
        - `toolConfirmation` → `permissions`
        - `internalResources` → `resources` (and removes the unused `enabled` flag)
        - runtime “plugins” → “hooks” (to avoid confusion with Claude Code-style plugins)
    - CLI UX: removes headless/positional prompt mode; `--prompt` now starts the interactive CLI with an initial prompt.
    - CLI UX: the “Agent config updates available” sync prompt reappears on subsequent runs until agents are synced (no per-version dismissal).
    - Tool surface refactor: removes `custom`/`internal` tool ID prefixes; MCP tools remain namespaced.
    - Approval UX:
        - Directory access prompts now auto-approve parallel pending requests after the first approval (reduces repetitive prompts during multi-tool flows).
        - Remembering a tool for the session now auto-approves parallel pending tool approvals for that tool.
    - New and updated tools:
        - Adds built-in Exa `web_search` + `code_search` tools.
        - Enables built-in `http_request` (“Fetch”) in the default and coding agents.
        - Refines tool display names for readability (e.g. “Update Todos”, “Web Search”, “Code Search”, “Check Task”, “List Tasks”).
        - Adds `@dexto/tools-lifecycle` (view logs + memory management) and moves session search into lifecycle tools.
    - UI terminology: “task list” → “todo list”.
    - Images:
        - `DextoImageModule` renamed to `DextoImage`.
        - `dexto image create` scaffold includes minimal examples for tools/hooks/storage/compaction.
- c862605: Add workspace management across core and server, improve MCP server configuration handling, and expand tool behavior (streaming tool-input events, new built-in http_request/sleep with safer request handling, and workspace-aware filesystem/process tools).
