## üåü Overview

Saiki is an AI Agent that makes it easy to use computers, applications and services using natural language. You type what you want to do and Saiki figures out which tools to use and how to execute them correctly.

What makes Saiki powerful for developers:

1. **Flexible Integrations**: Easily connect multiple existing systems and services to Saiki using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Integrate with GitHub, filesystem operations, terminal commands, and more without complex setup. Saiki's modular design means you can add exactly the capabilities you need. More on this [here](https://github.com/truffle-ai/saiki/edit/release/docs/README.md#-extensions)

2. **In-built Orchestration**: Once you've configured your servers and start using Saiki, it will automatically figure out when and how to use the tools to accomplish your task.
   
3. **Customizable Interfaces**: Create tailored interfaces for your specific use cases - from CLI to web interfaces. Saiki's architecture separates the AI logic from the presentation layer.

Saiki eliminates the need to learn different syntaxes or switch between multiple tools. Whether you're automating development workflows, creating specialized assistants, or building productivity tools, Saiki provides the foundation you need.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm
- OpenAI/Anthropic API key

### Quick Start

1. **Install and build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/truffle-ai/saiki/ && cd saiki
npm install
npm run build
```

2. **Configure your API key:**
Create a .env file and add your API key
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
```

3. **Launch Saiki:**
```bash
npm start
```

That's it! You're now ready to interact with Saiki through the command line.

## üíª Use Cases

Here are some examples of what you can do with Saiki:

### Code Operations
```
> Find all TODO comments in the src directory
> Create a new React component called UserProfile
> Show me files changed in the last commit
```

### Development Workflow
```
> Start the dev server
> Run tests for the auth module
> Show available npm scripts
```

### File Management
```
> Find all files modified in the last week
> Create a new directory called "reports"
> Zip all log files into an archive
```

### GitHub Integration
```
> Show open pull requests on this repository
> Create an issue for the performance bug
> Check the status of the CI pipeline
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Saiki uses a YAML configuration file (`configuration/saiki.yml`) to define which tools and LLM model you want to connect:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  github:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: your-github-token
  filesystem:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
      - .
llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4
  apiKey: env:OPENAI_API_KEY
```

You can use `configuration/saiki.yml` directly, or you can use a custom configuration file:
```bash
npm start -- --config-file path/to/your/config.yml
```

In order to use a different llm provider, change the llm section in the config.

For detailed configuration options and examples, see the [Configuration Guide](./configuration/README.md).

## üîå Extensions

Saiki's power comes from its extensibility. You can easily add new capabilities by:

1. **Using Existing Tool Servers**: Connect pre-built MCP-compatible servers for services GitHub, filesystem, terminal, etc. [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/) has a large set of pre-built MCP servers. [Composio](https://mcp.composio.dev/) has MCP servers with in-built managed auth.

2. **Creating Custom Servers**: Build your own tool servers to add specialized functionality.

Popular tool servers:
- GitHub: Manage repositories, issues, PRs
- Filesystem: File and directory operations
- Terminal: Run shell commands
- Desktop Commander: Control desktop applications

For creating custom servers, check out the [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
