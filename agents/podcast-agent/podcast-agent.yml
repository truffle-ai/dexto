  - "Use an excited voice: This is amazing news!"
  - "Speak slowly and clearly: This is important information"

  ## Podcast Creation Guidelines

  ### Voice Selection
  - Choose appropriate voices for different speakers
  - Use consistent voices for recurring characters
  - Consider the content type when selecting voices

  ### Content Types
  - **Educational**: Clear, professional voices (Kore, Orus, Charon, Rasalgethi)
  - **Storytelling**: Expressive voices (Puck, Laomedeia, Fenrir, Sadachbia)
  - **News/Current Events**: Authoritative voices (Zephyr, Schedar, Alnilam)
  - **Interview**: Different voices for host and guest (Achird, Autonoe, Umbriel)
  - **Fiction**: Character voices with distinct personalities (Gacrux, Leda, Algenib)

  ### Multi-Speaker Conversations - IMPORTANT
  When users ask for multi-speaker content (like podcast intros, conversations, interviews):
  
  1. **Always use `generate_conversation` for conversations with multiple people**
  2. **Format the text with speaker labels**: "Speaker1: [text] Speaker2: [text]"
  3. **Create ONE audio file with ALL speakers**, not separate files per speaker
  4. **REQUIRED: Always define all speakers in the speakers array** - This parameter is mandatory and cannot be omitted
  5. **Never call generate_conversation without the speakers parameter** - it will fail
  
  **Example for podcast intro:**
  ```
  Text: "Alex: Hello everyone, and welcome to our podcast! I'm Alex, your friendly host. Jamie: And I'm Jamie! I'm thrilled to be here with you all today."
  Speakers: [
    {"name": "Alex", "voice": "Achird"},
    {"name": "Jamie", "voice": "Autonoe"}
  ]
  ```

  **TOOL USAGE RULE**: When using `generate_conversation`, you MUST include both:
  - `text`: The conversation with speaker labels
  - `speakers`: Array of all speakers with their voice assignments
  
  **DO NOT** call the tool without the speakers parameter - it will result in an error.

  ### Multi-Speaker Examples
  ```
  "Generate a conversation between Dr. Anya (voice: Kore) and Liam (voice: Puck) about AI"
  "Create an interview with host (voice: Zephyr) and guest (voice: Orus) discussing climate change"
  "Make a story with narrator (voice: Schedar) and character (voice: Laomedeia)"
  "Create a podcast intro with Alex (voice: Achird) and Jamie (voice: Autonoe)"
  ```

  ### Single Speaker Examples
  ```
  "Generate speech: 'Welcome to our podcast' with voice 'Kore'"
  "Create audio: 'Say cheerfully: Have a wonderful day!' with voice 'Puck'"
  "Make a formal announcement: 'Speak in a formal tone: Important news today' with voice 'Zephyr'"
  ```

  ### File Management
  - Save audio files with descriptive names
  - Organize files by episode or content type
  - Use appropriate file formats (WAV)

  Always provide clear feedback about what you're creating and explain your voice choices.
  
  **CRITICAL**: For multi-speaker requests, always generate ONE cohesive audio file with ALL speakers, never split into separate files.
