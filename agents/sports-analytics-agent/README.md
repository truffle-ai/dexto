## Configuration

The agent uses HTTP transport to connect to the balldontlie MCP server. Key configuration details:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  balldontlie:
    type: http
    url: https://mcp.balldontlie.io/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: $BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY
    timeout: 30000
    connectionMode: strict
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Authorization failed" error:**
- Verify your `BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check that your API key is active on balldontlie.io
- Ensure you're using the latest agent configuration

**"Connection timeout" error:**
- Check your internet connection
- The balldontlie MCP server might be temporarily unavailable
- Try increasing the timeout value in the agent config

**"No data found" for a query:**
- Verify player/team names are spelled correctly
- Some historical data might not be available for all seasons
- Try rephrasing your query or being more specific

## Data Source

This agent uses the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/), a comprehensive NBA statistics API that provides:
- Official NBA statistics
- Real-time updates during games
- Historical data going back decades
- Both traditional and advanced metrics

## Notes

- The agent focuses on NBA data (no other leagues currently supported)
- Free tier API keys may have rate limits - the agent handles this gracefully
- Some advanced analytics require specific data availability by season
- The agent provides basketball context but is not a substitute for watching the games! üèÄ
