## Configuration

### Agent Configuration
The agent is configured in `music-agent.yml`:

```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are an AI assistant specialized in music creation, editing, and production...

mcpServers:
  music_creator:
    type: stdio
    command: uv
    args:
      - run
      - --project
      - agents/music-agent/python-server
      - python
      - agents/music-agent/python-server/main.py
    connectionMode: strict

llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  apiKey: $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Environment Variables
Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "uv command not found"
```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Restart your terminal or reload shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

#### 2. "FFmpeg not found" warnings
These warnings can be safely ignored. The agent includes fallback methods using librosa and soundfile for audio processing when FFmpeg is not available.

```bash
# Optional: Install FFmpeg for optimal performance
brew install ffmpeg  # macOS
sudo apt install ffmpeg  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

#### 3. "Permission denied" on setup script
```bash
chmod +x setup-python-server.sh
```

#### 4. Dependency Issues
If you encounter dependency problems:
```bash
cd agents/music-agent/python-server
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
uv run python test-setup.py
```

#### 5. JSON Serialization Errors
These have been fixed in the current version. If you encounter them, ensure you're using the latest code.
